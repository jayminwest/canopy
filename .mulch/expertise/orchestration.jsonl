Scouts skipped — SPEC.md provided complete file specifications. Self-verified both diffs against spec rather than spawning reviewers (simple config files, no runnable quality gates). Builders tend to modify .mulch/ files outside scope — flag for merger to handle selectively.","classification":"tactical","recorded_at":"2026-02-23T18:47:57.701Z","outcomes":[{"status":"success","agent":"infra-lead"}],"id":"mx-4358d3"}
